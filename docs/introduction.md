您好，欢迎来到swarm! 非常高兴来到这里和我们一起! 🐝 

只要你的bee客户端启动并且运行中，你将会连接到全世界的节点并且成为swarm的一部分，一个可以存储和分发全世界数据内容的完全的p2p网络系统。

Swarm是一个去中心化的数据存储和分布式技术，准备下一代抗审查、不停止无服务应用。

Swarm is a decentralised data storage and distribution technology, ready to power the next generation of censorship resistant, unstoppable serverless apps.

Swarm is economically self-sustaining due to a built-in incentive system enforced through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Swarm aspires to shape the future towards a self-sovereign global society and permissionless open markets. Applications can run autonomously yet securely in a planetary-scale deployment and execution environment.

# Bee

## Installation
Don't have Bee installed yet? It's easy! Head over to the [installation](/docs/installation/quick-start) section to get Bee up and running.

## Working With Bee
Once you have Bee installed, find out how to configure your software, interact with the API, monitor what Bee is up to, and make those all important backups in the [working with Bee](/docs/working-with-bee/introduction) section.

## Access the Swarm
To learn more about how to get the most out of Bee, find out how to [access the swarm](/docs/access-the-swarm/upload-and-download) section so you can share files with your friends, use Bee to host a website on a public Swarm Gateway, and much more!
	
## API Reference
[Find detailed information](/docs/api-reference/api-reference) on all the endpoints available in the autogenerated <a href="/api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API reference</a> and <a href="/debug-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Debug API reference</a> guides.

## Dapps
Swarm is all about dapps. We strive to provide the most developer friendly environment on which to build your decentralised organisation. Built on the principles of functionality, flexibility and accessibility, Bee provides high level constructs for file storage, feeds and key-value stores, while also providing the low level access with libraries that create Single Owner and Trojan chunks clientside, with total e2e privacy. Learn more about how to [develop on Swarm](/docs/dapps-on-swarm/introduction)

## Development
You are invited to contribute code to the Bee Client or any of the other projects in Swarm's [Ethersphere](https://github.com/ethersphere).
